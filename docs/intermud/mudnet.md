*Mudnet* is a heavily modified variant of [MushLink](Mushlink) that made its 
debut in 1997. Like MushLink, it operates as a bot user with special permissions
that logs into the MUSH.<br/>
Like MushLink a *Mudnet* central server connects to the MU* server as a special 
player that has associated softcode for its operation. 

To get access to the network, you had to request it via a [webform](https://web.archive.org/web/20110526114024/http://www.mudnet.org/about-policy.php).<br/> 
Appplications for this network have been closed in 2010
