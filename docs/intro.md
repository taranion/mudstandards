# Welcome to MUD Standards

In the past (2010) **[mudstandards.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20120402093750/http://www.mudstandards.org/MudStandards_Wiki)** was an [attempt](https://www.zuggsoft.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=34869) from several active client and server developers to create a centralized location for all MUD protocols. The Wiki existed for some years, got hacked and vanished

This page is meant to repeat the effort - this time not as an Wiki, but a public Github repository for Github Pages.

There are other good sites that give an overview over related protocols:

- [MUD Protocol Archive](https://www.last-outpost.com/LO/protocols/)
  from The Last Outpost
- [MUDHalla](https://tintin.mudhalla.net/protocols/)
  From the TinTin++ staff
